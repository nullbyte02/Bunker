			<li class="emph">Why does X not work or look weird?</li>
			<li>Linking pages is slightly difficult, and these errors sometimes slip by</li>
			<li>As for things not looking good, would you rather me spend time on making random things look go or actually make them?</li>
			<li>Just note I am the only person in about four to five schools doing this, I have homework too</li>
			<wbr>
			<li class="emph">Why can't Go&zwj;Guardian see this page?</li>
			<li>Extensions can only access file pages if allowed by the users, as they are by default not able to</li>
			<li>Whenever this is because the school forgot to patch this setting or because it would be a security risk if they could,<br>this option is what allows these things to happen</li>
			<wbr>
			<li class="emph">Can I use the proxies to go on stuff?</li>
			<li>Yes, the proxies have been fully implemented, and using about:blank and other things, we are able to put the proxies into bunker.</li>
			<wbr>
			<li class="emph">Why is chat not working?</li>
			<li>The chatroom may be down, or just off due to spam. It is currently being redone so there may be some issues.</li>
			<li></li>
			<li>Otherwise, you can get to apps, and other things by typing their file path into there.</li>
			<li>If you don't know what the file path to things are, you can try looking at bunker files, or on our github.</li>
			<wbr>
			<li class="emph">What are apps?</li>
			<li>Each app is a different plugin to the home screen, and sometimes beyond (example: communication<br>has multiple back pages)</li>
			<li>Since this "site" is just files on a usb drive, users can install apps as they like, for example<br>a game list app, or a news/rss feed app</li>
			<wbr>
			<li class="emph">How do I use the "File Path" Optiom?</li>
			<li>The file path option allows you to get to apps, and other pages within bunker faster.</li>
			<li>If something is broken, or not working just enter /index.html into the file path.</li>
			<li>Otherwise, you can get to apps, and other things by typing their file path into there.</li>
			<li>If you don't know what the file path to things are, you can try looking at bunker files, or on our github.</li>
			<wbr>
			<li class="emph">How is this hidden from my history?</li>
			<li>about:blank is hidden from your history as it isn't a real URL</li>
			<li>If you check your history, you will see that it does not appear as what you were on, and clicking on it will do nothing.</li>
			<wbr>
			<li class="emph">How do I install apps?</li>
			<li>Download and extract the app's folder, then place it under the <code>apps</code> folder</li>
			<li>Be careful not to rename the folder, as it will break the app</li>
			<li>Then open config.json (in the root folder of this site) and add a item with the app's folder name</li>
			<li>The config.json file will have a few apps already on it, so follow the same pattern</li>
			<li><code>"apps":["app1", "app2", "app3"]</code> adding "app4" would look like <code>"apps":["app1", "app2", "app3", "app4"]</code></li>
