<h2> How to use bunker, (in general): </h2>
<br>
<p> Once you have opened bunker, and hopefully navigated to this page. There are many things you can do.<p><br>
<p> Navigating to the YT Downloader box will give you a few options. One is to search by term or ID. If you search by term </p> <br>
<p>think of it as a YouTube search bar. The ID section needs a specific ID which can be found at the end of a YouTube video. </p> <br>
<p>In the proxy selector, just click on a proxy from the drop down. If you click a proxy and it doesn't work, try a different one. </p> <br>
<p>The chatroom allows you to make an account or login to a chat area, which you can talk in and interact with others. </p> <br>
<p>If you want to add games ping @Catt#5172 in discord.gg/mathstudy with an HTML file or folder. They will be added Ina future update </p> <br>
<p>if possible.</p>
